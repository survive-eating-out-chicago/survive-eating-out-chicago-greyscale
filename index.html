          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Nowadays, food establishments such as restaurants have become part of our daily lives. Chicago is a great example of a big city which gathers a huge variety of such establishments. As such, we focus our project on facilities located there.</p>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">In this project, we firstly try to understand which <strong>factors</strong> are most at stake when talking about <strong>food safety</strong> in food establishments in Chicago. In the process, we also take a detour and use socio-economic indicators of Chicago community areas in order to see if <strong>eating safely is equally accessible</strong> to all members of society. To this end, we will see whether our dataset supports the existence of <i>food deserts</i> in Chicago.</p>
           <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Our ultimate aim is to promote public health by computing a <i>Safety Score</i> based on information from inspections as well as other metrics that prove useful during analysis. The Chicago residents can use this score to safely decide where to eat out.</p>

  	<h3><strong>The data</strong></h3><!---where our journey starts.</h3>-->
    <hr>
    <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"> Our starting point is the Chicago Food Inspection data set, which contains information about the inspections of food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 up to the present. As we will see further down, each inspection is accompanied by information about the inspected facility such as its location and its type (restaurant, medical establishment, school...). The inspection outcome depends on whether the establishment was found to have any of the 45 possible violations, and in this research we consider the following results:
    <ul>
	  <font color="green"><li><strong>Pass</strong>: No critical or serious violations</li></font>
	  <font color="orange"><li><strong>Pass With Conditions</strong>: Criticial or serious violations found, but corrected during inspection</li></font>
	  <font color="red"><li><strong>Fail</strong>: Critical or serious violations, dangerous for the public health, found during inspection</li></font>
	</ul> 
    </p>

             <!-- <p>On average the proportions of results seem very different in terms of type of establishment.

            <p><strong>Some insights:</strong><br>The proportion of facilities which get a pass in their reinspection is bigger than that which get a pass at their first inspection. This makes sense as establishments take into consideration the comments given by the inspectors before their reinspections.
            <br>We can alse see that the proportion of passes with conditions is smaller for the reinspections. This makes sense as giving such a result would mean giving establishments "a third chance".</p>

	                <p><strong>Some insights:</strong><br>Surprisingly, the riskiest establishments seem to get the least fails. This might be due to their awareness of the matter and hence their care in maintaining their sanitation.<br>Establishments with the highest risk also get the highest proportion of passes with conditions.

            <hr>
            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"> We often expect to find diverse and numerous food places in big cities. However, we found that in some areas of Chicago, residents are <strong> lacking access to healthy and affordable food options </strong> due to the <strong> absence of grocery stores within convenient travelling distance. </strong> This phenomenon is referred to as a <i>food desert</i>, a.k.a. food apartheid. Further, in a <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/docs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf">report by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights</a>, it is stated that these <i>food desert</i> neighborhoods are almost exclusively in African American neighborhoods making the issue a civil rights one beyond its public health dimension.

            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">As we can see below, the grocery stores' density is <strong>positively correlated</strong> with <strong>Population Count</strong> by community area as well as with <strong>Per Capita Income</strong>. It is on the other hand <strong>negatively correlated</strong> with <strong>Below Poverty Level</strong>. These observations make sense if we think about grocery stores wanting to maximize their profit.
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket_shortage">"Grocery stores typically have only 1-2% profit margins, so the difficulties involved in running an urban supermarket are often seen as too costly in an already-risky business."</a>

            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">We compiled a technical score for several food esablishments in Chicago. This score heavily depends on the <strong>violations</strong> committed at the time of inspection (e.g. whether they were <strong>critical</strong> or not).</p>
            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"><a href="https://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/Code_Violations.jsp#critical"> Critical violations</a> include improper personal hygiene or rodent and/or insect infestation. <a href="https://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/Code_Violations.jspl"> <strong>Serious</strong> and <strong>monderate</strong> violations</a> include no proper protection from contamination or poorly constructed walls. The score takes into account the severity of critical violations and hence gives bigger weights to the attributes linked to them. It also takes into account whether there were cases of <strong>food poisoning</strong> caused by the establishment, or if there were any <strong>"hidden allergens"</strong> in the establishment. The pie chart below showcases the different weights given to the parameters we use to compute our score.

            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">The final score takes into account the opinion of the Yelp community by using the average user establishment rating. The map below showcases the final score. Simply use the slider to <strong>select the importance attributed to the user rating.</strong></p> <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">For example, selecting 0% will result in a total score that is equal to the technical score, whereas selecting 100% will result in a total score that is the user rating.
