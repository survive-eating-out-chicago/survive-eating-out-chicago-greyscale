          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">In this day and age, restaurants and other food establishments are part of our daily lives. In this project, we try to understand which <strong> factors</strong> are most at stake when talking about<strong> food safety</strong>. In the process, we will also take a detour and use socio-economic indicators of Chicago community areas in order to see if <strong>eating safely is equally accessible</strong> to everyone and if our dataset supports the existence of "food deserts".</p>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Our ultimate aim is to promote public health by providing a reliable recommendation system for eating out in Chicago, based on a "safety score" that we will compute using the information from inspections as well as other metrics that will prove useful during analysis.</p>

They either get passes or fails. This makes sense as food sanitation is a top priority in medical establishments given that most of their customers are patients.Medical establishments also have the highest number of failed inspections. This might be due to a stricter approach taken with them given that food cleaniness is the top priority for such facilities.On average the proportions of results seem very different in terms of type of establishment. But we can notice establishment types which form groups that have similar distributions of results. For example, restaurants, religious establishments and retirement homes seem to have very similar result distributions.</p>

This makes sense as establishments take into consideration the comments given by the inspector for the reinspection. We can alse see that the proportion of passes with conditions is smaller for the reinspections. This makes sense as giving such a result would mean giving establishments "a third chance".</p>

	                <p><strong>Some insights:</strong> Surprisingly, establishments with the highest risk seem to get the least fails. This might be due to their awareness of matter and hence their care in maintaining their sanitation.Establishments with the highest risk also get the highest proportion of passes with conditions. This could mean that inspectors might be less severe with them given that it is very challenging to maintain such a risky establishment. The proportion of passes seems independent of the risk of the facility.</p>

            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"> We often expect to find diverse and numerous food places in big cities. However, we found out that in some areas of Chicago, residents are <strong> lacking access to healthy and affordable food options </strong> due to the <strong> absence of grocery stores within convenient travelling distance. </strong> This phenomenon is referred to as Food Desert, a.k.a. food apartheid. Furthermore,  in a <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/docs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf">report by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights</a>, it is stated that these food desert neighborhoods are almost exclusively in African American neighborhoods making the issue a civil rights one beyond its public health dimension.

This score also takes into account whether there were cases of <strong>food poisoning</strong>, or if there were any <strong>"hidden allergens"</strong> in the establishment.
