In this project, we try to understand which <strong> factors</strong> are most at stake when talking about<strong> food safety</strong>. In the process, we will also take a detour and use socio-economic indicators of Chicago community areas in order to see if <strong>eating safely is equally accessible</strong> to everyone and if our dataset supports the existence of "food deserts".</p>
          <p class="text-white-50 mb-4">Our ultimate aim is to promote public health by providing a reliable recommendation system for eating out in Chicago, based on a "safety score" that we will compute using the information from inspections as well as other metrics that will prove useful during analysis.</p>

  	<h3><strong>The data </strong>: where our journey starts.</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"> Our starting point is the Chicago Food Inspection data, which contains up-to-date information from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. As we will see further down, each inspection is accompanied by precious information about the facility like its location or its type ( restaurant, medical establishment, school...). The inspection outcome depends on whether the establishemnt was found to have any of the 45 possible violations, and the result can be either of the following:
    <ul>
	  <font color="green"><li><strong>Pass</strong>: No critical or serious violations</li></font>
	  <font color="orange"><li><strong>Pass With Conditions</strong>: Presence of criticial or serious violations, but those were corrected during the inspection</li></font>
	  <font color="red"><li><strong>Fail</strong>: Critical or serious violations that were dangerous for the public health</li></font>
	</ul> 
    </p>

    <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">In this part of our research, we tried to get familiar with how inspection outcomes differ according to different establishment and inspection features. We also tried to examine and analyze the performance evolution of facilities in Chicago.

Medical establishments can not get passes with conditions: they either pass or fail the inspections. This strict approach might explain that they have the highest proportion of fails.</p>
             <p>On average the proportions of results seem very different in terms of type of establishment. But we can notice establishment types which form groups that have similar distributions of results. For example, restaurants, religious establishments and retirement homes seem to have very similar result distributions.</p>

This makes sense as establishments take into consideration the comments given by the inspector for the reinspection. We can alse see that the proportion of passes with conditions is smaller for the reinspections. This makes sense as giving such a result would mean giving establishments "a third chance".</p>

	                <p><strong>Some insights:</strong> Surprisingly, establishments with the highest risk seem to get the least fails. This might be due to their awareness of matter and hence their care in maintaining their sanitation.Establishments with the highest risk also get the highest proportion of passes with conditions. This could mean that inspectors might be less severe with them given that it is very challenging to maintain such a risky establishment. The proportion of passes seems independent of the risk of the facility.</p>

            <hr>
            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0"> We often expect to find diverse and numerous food places in big cities. However, we found out that in some areas of Chicago, residents are <strong> lacking access to healthy and affordable food options </strong> due to the <strong> absence of grocery stores within convenient travelling distance. </strong> This phenomenon is referred to as Food Desert, a.k.a. food apartheid. Furthermore,  in a <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/docs/IL-FoodDeserts-2011.pdf">report by the Illinois Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights</a>, it is stated that these food desert neighborhoods are almost exclusively in African American neighborhoods making the issue a civil rights one beyond its public health dimension.

            <h5><strong><i> A Technical Score</i></strong>...</h5>
            <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">Based on the Chicago Food Inspection data, we compiled a score for several food esablishments in Chicago. This score was heavily influenced by the <strong>violations</strong> commited at the time of the inspection, and whether they were <strong>critical</strong> or not. <a href="https://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/Code_Violations.jsp#critical"> Critical violations</a> include improper personal hygiene or rodent and/or insect infestation. <a href="https://webapps1.chicago.gov/healthinspection/Code_Violations.jspl"> <strong>Serious</strong> and <strong>monderate</strong> violations</a> include no proper protection from contamination or poorly constructed walls. CRITICAL VIOLATIONS MORE WEIGHT THAN MODERATE
            </p>
             <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">The technical score takes into account whether there were cases of <strong>food poisoning</strong> caused by the establishment, or if there were any <strong>"hidden allergens"</strong> in the establishment.

The map below can take into account the ratings of the establishments present on Yelp: simply use the slider to <strong>select the importance attributed to this average rating.</strong></p> <p class="text-black-70 mb-0">Selecting 0 will result in a Total Score equal to the technical score, whereas selecting 5 will result in a  Total Score where the Technical Score is as important as the User Score.
